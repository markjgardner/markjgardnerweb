							<h2>Mark J Gardner</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Software engineer specializing in Cloud and DevOps with 17+ years of experience developing enterprise solutions.</p>
						<p>I am a highly skilled software engineer who specializes in DevOps and platform development. I enjoy building the tools and processes that enable application developers to deliver great experiences to their end users. I have broad experience with a diverse set of application frameworks, cloud platforms, operating systems, SaaS solutions and integrations. I get particularly excited about orchestrating disparate systems into complex functional flows to solve unique business problems. I am an agile enthusiast who prefers to work on a Kanban team. I have had great success leveraging SAFe to manage work within large organizations. I am a strong proponent of declarative syntax, loosely-coupled architectures and pragmatic DevOps.</p>
